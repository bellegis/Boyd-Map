								</h2>
									<br>
									<br>
													In the 1930s Louise Arner Boyd funded and led 5 scientific expeditions
										to East Greenland and took teams of geologists, botanists, surveyors, and physiographers.
									<br>
									<br>
												This map focuses on their 1931 expedition to extremities of the Franz Josef Fjord.
									<br>
									<br>
									Louise conceived of this journey as a “photographic reconnaissance” in order to prepare
									 herself and this team for their more comprehensive survey of the region to come later in 1933.
									<br>
 									<br>
									This journey was conducted in cooperation with the American Geographical Society of New York.
									The American Geographical Society Library (AGSL) now holds nearly 3,000 images taken by Boyd primarily covering
									her expeditions to Greenland (over 1,000 photos) and her photo survey of Poland (nearly 1,800 images).
									<br>
									<br>
									Extensive coverage of Boyd's expeditions are available in her two books, “The Fiord Region of East Greenland”
									(1935) and “The Coast of Northeast Greenland,” (1948). Both publications are available in the AGS Library
									holdings.
									<br>
									<br>

									In these texts, Boyd tells of her earlier journeys to the polar sea, when she visited Franz Josef Land in 1924,
									 and aided in the search for famed lost explorer Amundsen in 1928. These trips, she explains,
									 acquainted her with the polar environment, marine ice, and the hazardous conditions she would later
									 encounter in the trips of 1931 and 1933.
									<br>
 									<br>
									“The reward of crossing,” these hazardous conditions, she writes, “is access to a land of extraordinary
									grandeur and beauty.”
									<br>
									<br>
									Her photographs taken during the 1931 and 1933 expeditions depict “topographic forms, glaciers, sea ice,
									fine scenery, animal life, and flora.”
									<br>
									<br>
									Boyd describes “a large fan-shaped and partly submerged delta on the west side at the bend of the fjord
									extends so far out that they had to steer to the far east side of Kjerulfs Fjord to “avoid grounding.”
									<br>
									<br>
									She speculates that all of the icebergs in Kjerulfs fjord almost certainly drifted in from Franz Josefs Fjord,
									 because no glacier terminates in Kjerulfs.
									 <br>
									 <br>
									 The group saw various animals during these trips, including muskox, Greenland hare, one walrus
									 (in Franz Josefs Fjord), narwals (“plentiful” at the outer end of Kjerulfs Fjord), and birds like raven,
									  wild geese, and eider duck.
										<br>
										<br>
										There were no permanent human settlements, but the group did find wooden huts where Danish and Norwegian
										hunters camped.
										<br>
										<br>
										Use this map to see which vantage point Louise took photographs from during her 1931 expedition
										to extremities of the Franz Josef Fjord.
										<br>
										<br>
										Toggle on the manuscript map Boyd drew, and see how the data points correspond to her photo notations
										indicating where each image was taken from (her annotations are noted on the reverse side of the photos).

					This map is the brain child of Susan Peschel, Visual Resources Librarian at the American Geographical Society Library.
					Susan dreamt up the concept of this map years ago, and worked tirelessly with Susan Dykes in creating metadata and preparing
					these images for web access. This project would not have been possible without them.
					<br>
					<br>
					Many thanks to Ann Hanlon, Max Cozzi, and the team over at UWM Digital Collections for rapid-fire digitization of the images
					featured in this project. Thanks to Fritz Nelson for taking the time to share his extensive knowledge of Louise A. Boyd, polar
					exploration, and the American Geographical Society.
					<br>
					<br>
					A special thanks to Benjamin Schroeder, who taught me almost everything I know about Javascript, jQuery, and Leaflet. Thank you Ben for all
					your help, and for inspiring in me an interest in web development in the first place. Finally, thanks to Marcy Bidney and Stephen Appel
					for continual support and brilliance.
					<br>
					<br>
					The American Geographical Society Library (AGSL), one of the premier collections of its kind in North America, contains over 1.3 million items
					supporting instruction, research and outreach at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and around the world.
					<br>
					<br>
					The collection contains maps, atlases, books periodicals, film media and digital data files. Its scope is worldwide with coverage from the
					15th century to the present. Its resources have been used to produce an ongoing series of digital collections, including an award winning website
					on Afghanistan, a comprehensive site on world transportation and collections featuring unique photographic documentation of such places as Tibet,
					the Republic of Georgia, Korea and World War II Poland. The AGSL offers scholarly programs for the campus and local community throughout the year
					and welcomes visiting scholars from across the US and the world.
